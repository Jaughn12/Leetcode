# 30 Days LeetCode Challenge

## Day 2: Bubble Sort (C)

This is my solution for the Bubble Sort algorithm implemented in C as part of the 30 Days LeetCode Challenge. It is my second day of the challenge.

## Problem Description

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts an array of integers in ascending order by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

## Solution Explanation

The C code provided implements the Bubble Sort algorithm using recursion. It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if necessary, repeating this process until the array is sorted. The code uses a helper function `swap` to swap two elements and the `sortColors` function to perform the sorting.

## How to Run the Code

To run the code, you can compile the C file and execute the resulting program. The main function initializes an array, calls the `bubbleSort` function to sort it, and prints the original and sorted arrays.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Bubble Sort algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst and average case, and O(n) in the best case. This is because the algorithm requires multiple passes through the array, comparing and swapping adjacent elements. The space complexity is O(1) as it does not require additional space.

## Day 2: Bubble Sort (Python)

This is my solution for the Bubble Sort algorithm implemented in Python as part of the 30 Days LeetCode Challenge. It is my second day of the challenge.

## Problem Description

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts a list of elements in ascending order by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

## Solution Explanation

The Python code provided implements the Bubble Sort algorithm using a nested loop structure. It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if necessary, continuing this process until the list is sorted. The code uses a variable `swapped` to track whether any swaps were made during a pass, optimizing the algorithm by stopping early if the list is already sorted.

## How to Run the Code

To run the code, you can execute the `sortColors` function, passing the `nums` list as an argument. The function sorts the list in-place, modifying it directly.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Bubble Sort algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst and average case, and O(n) in the best case. This is because the algorithm requires multiple passes through the list, comparing and swapping adjacent elements. The space complexity is O(1) as it does not require additional space.
