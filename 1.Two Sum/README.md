## Day 4: Two Sum (Python)

This is the implementation of the Two Sum problem in Python. It finds two numbers in a list that add up to a given target number.

### Code

The Python code is available in the file [twosum.py](twosum.py).

### Usage

To test the implementation, you can call the `twosum` function with a list of numbers and the target number. Here's an example:

```python
print(twosum([2, 4, 3, 5], 8))
```

The output will be the indices of the numbers that add up to the target.

## Day 4: Two Sum (C)

This is the C implementation of the Two Sum problem. It finds two numbers in an array that add up to a given target number.

### Code

The C code is available in the file [twosum.c](twosum.c).

### Usage

To test the implementation, you can compile and run the C code. Here's an example:

```bash
gcc twosum.c -o twosum
./twosum
```

The output will be the indices of the numbers that add up to the target, or a message indicating no solution was found.
