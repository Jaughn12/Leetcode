# 30 Days LeetCode Challenge

## Day 6: Insertion Sort

Today is the 6th day of the 30 days LeetCode challenge. The task for today is to implement the Insertion Sort algorithm in two different programming languages: Python and C.

### Python Implementation

The Python implementation is provided in the file `Insertionsort.py`. It uses the insertion sort algorithm to sort a singly linked list in ascending order.

To run the Python implementation, execute the following command:
```
python Insertionsort.py
```

### C Implementation

The C implementation is provided in the file `Insertionsort.c`. It implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort a singly-linked list in ascending order.

To compile and run the C implementation, execute the following commands:
```
gcc Insertionsort.c -o insertion_sort
./insertion_sort
```

Feel free to check the source code files for detailed comments explaining the logic and steps involved in each implementation.
