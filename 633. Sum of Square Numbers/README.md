## Day 5: Judge Square Sum

This is my 5th day of the 30 Days LeetCode Challenge. Today, I worked on the "Judge Square Sum" problem. The problem statement asks to determine whether there exist two integers `a` and `b` such that `a^2 + b^2 = c`.

## Implementation

- [C Implementation](squaresum.c): This is my C implementation for the problem. It takes a non-negative integer `c` as input and checks whether there exist two integers `a` and `b` satisfying the equation. It uses a while loop to iterate through possible values of `a` and `b` and returns a boolean result.

- [Python Implementation](squaresum.py): This is my Python implementation for the problem. It uses the fact that for `b>0`,it implies that square root of `c^2-a^2>0` i.e `a^2 < c`.

Both implementations provide the solution for the problem, and the code is thoroughly commented for better understanding.
