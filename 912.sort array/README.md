# 30 Days LeetCode Challenge

## Day 3: Sorting Algorithms

### Description
On the third day of the 30 Days LeetCode challenge, I implemented two popular sorting algorithms: Merge Sort and Heap Sort. Sorting algorithms are essential for solving many coding problems efficiently, and understanding their implementation is crucial for algorithmic problem-solving.

### Code
- [Merge Sort](mergesort.py): This code implements the Merge Sort algorithm in Python. It recursively divides the input list into halves, sorts them separately, and then merges the sorted halves into a single sorted list.
- [Heap Sort](heapsort.c): This code implements the Heap Sort algorithm in C. It builds a max heap from the input array, repeatedly extracts the maximum element, and places it at the end of the array.

### Usage
You can use the provided code as a reference for implementing and understanding Merge Sort and Heap Sort. Feel free to modify the code or use it in your own projects as needed.
